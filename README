Notes by Eric Meeks
To set up in Eclipse.

1. Get source from GitHub
2. Create workspace above VIVO-OpenSocial directory
3. File->New->Project...Java Project 
		Choose VIVO-OpenSocial or just type it in
4. Accept all defaults
5. After things settle down, remove vitro-core sources
6. Add vitro-core as a separate project.  
	In the File->New->Project...Java Project you will need to unclick use default
	location and browse to vitro-core
6. In VIVO-OpenSocial go to Properties and add vitro-core as a dependency in
	the Java Build Path (Required projects on the build path)
7. If needed edit web.xml for vivosolr.  Copy solr/home from context.xml 
	into obvious location in web.xml and uncomment.
