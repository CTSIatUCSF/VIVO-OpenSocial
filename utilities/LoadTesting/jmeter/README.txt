Contains a distribution of JMeter. The _runTest script looks here to find
the executable of JMeter, and also to find the XSL stylesheet used to convert *.jtl files to *.html files.

Currently, we're using JMeter 2.4, so the directory contains jakarta-jmeter-2.4.zip and
an unpacked version in the directory jakarta-jmeter-2.4
