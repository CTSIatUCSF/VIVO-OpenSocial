Contains all sorts of data that is particular to each site.

MySQL dumps.
  The ones we got from the drop box, and anything that we derived from them
  that was worth capturing instead of rebuilding.

Zip of upload directory
  Either obtained from the drop box, or what we created using UploadImageFaker

CSV files containing test data
  We create CSV files that contina URIs of Persons, InfoResources, and Authors.
  The tests use these files when deciding which pages to fetch. These are site
  dependent.

Also contains the _patches_and_queries directory, which contains its own readme file.
