			<h4>
				<a name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-Overview"></a>Overview
			</h4>
			<p>VIVO 1.5 introduces a number of new features addressing
				extensibility and interoperability, reasoning, page customization,
				and a first step toward internationalization. VIVO's profile
				management has been improved with a number of new custom forms, and
				there are significant improvements to ontology browsing and editing.</p>

			<p>The VIVO 1.5 development cycle has also included extensive
				design work on features anticipated for implementation beginning
				with version 1.6, including increased modularity, the introduction
				of a separate ontology for display and editing controls, and the
				addition of a graphical ontology class expression editor.</p>

			<h4>
				<a name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-Extensibility"></a>Extensibility
			</h4>
			<p>Since version 1.2, VIVO’s use of the Jena Semantic Web
				framework (1) has allowed implementation sites to use any database
				supported by Jena, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. VIVO
				Release 1.5 extends this flexibility a major step further by making
				it much easier to extend VIVO to use any triple store, and include
				an experimental feature that supports connecting to any triple store
				that exposes a SPARQL endpoint that supports SPARQL update. Initial
				tests with Sesame are quite promising.</p>

			<h4>
				<a name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-VIVOisnowanOpenSocialcontainer"></a>VIVO
				is now an OpenSocial container
			</h4>
			<p>The OpenSocial standard (2) defines a web-based container
				environment for hosting third-party components in a web application
				and provides a set of common application programming interfaces for
				developing these components by leveraging the Google Gadgets (3)
				framework. Eric Meeks and colleagues at the University of
				California–San Francisco and other institutions have developed
				OpenSocial gadgets designed to work with RDF expressed using the
				VIVO ontology. For VIVO 1.5, Eric has adapted the Apache Shindig (4)
				OpenSocial reference implementation to communicate with VIVO and
				collaborated with the VIVO development team in extending VIVO itself
				to support OpenSocial gadgets referencing data in VIVO or bringing
				additional data to VIVO based on page being viewed.</p>

			<h4>
				<a name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-Reasoning"></a>Reasoning
			</h4>
			<p>The simple reasoner built into VIVO now has support for sameAs
				reasoning to allow joint display of statements associated with two
				URIs that have been asserted or inferred to be sameAs each other.
				The VIVO reasoner will also now maintain inverse property statements
				based on presence or absence of inverse property declarations in an
				ontology. Although the VIVO application has previously added and
				removed property inverse statements during interactive editing, this
				feature had been requested to simplify the preparation of data for
				ingest with the VIVO Harvester or other tools. Recomputing
				inferences will trigger the reasoner to supply any missing inverse
				property statements.</p>

			<h4>
				<a name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-Newpagetypes"></a>New page types
			</h4>
			<p>The VIVO 1.5 release expands the flexibility of VIVO as a web
				application by adding additional dynamic content features. Sites may
				create arbitrary HTML pages or web pages that display the results of
				SPARQL queries and link to those from any template in the
				application; these new pages may optionally be top-level menu pages
				and may include multiple sections featuring the results of
				parameterized SPARQL queries and static HTML content as well as data
				filtered by class group and type. New page specifications are
				typically paired with page template modifications to provide the
				desired level of control over display of dynamic content. These
				changes significantly augment VIVO's native reporting capabilities
				and enable sites to demonstrate aggregation, interconnectivity, and
				network effects in VIVO data. Queries and report templates will be
				useful to share across sites and a SPARQL resource page has already
				been established on the VIVO wiki (5).</p>

			<h4>
				<a name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-Customizedshortviews"></a>Customized
				short views
			</h4>
			<p>Site maintainers may also customize the way that individuals
				are displayed on VIVO index pages, browse pages, or search results -
				all without modifying the basic VIVO code. Custom templates,
				populated by custom queries, can be assigned to classes of
				individuals in any of these contexts.</p>

			<h4>
				<a name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-Languagefilter"></a>Language
				filter
			</h4>

			<p>VIVO 1.5 will respect a user's browser language preference
				setting and filter labels and data property text strings to only
				display values matching that language setting whenever versions in
				multiple languages are available. This is an important first step
				toward internationalization of the VIVO application, an effort we
				expect to continue in future releases.</p>

			<h4>
				<a name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-Improvedediting"></a>Improved
				editing
			</h4>
			<p>VIVO 1.5 includes new forms to simplify entry and editing of
				awards, advising relationships, and additional types of
				publications. Forms make greater use of autocomplete functionality,
				and very large pick lists are converted to autocomplete
				functionality by the application on the fly.</p>

			<h4>
				<a
					name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-ImprovedMapofSciencevisualization"></a>Improved
				Map of Science visualization
			</h4>
			<p>VIVO's Map of Science visualizations benefit from improved
				labeling and color coding as well as additional explanation; the
				maps also now support dynamic interchange between discipline and
				sub-discipline sliders.</p>

			<h4>
				<a name="VIVORelease1.5Announcement-Ontologychanges"></a>Ontology
				changes
			</h4>
			<p>
				Ontology changes from 1.4 to 1.5 include identifying primary job
				appointments, modeling citation information for publications, and
				adding new types of publications to better align with PubMed.
				Changes for each release are documented on the VIVO wiki on
				Sourceforge at <a
					href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/vivo/index.php?title=Ontology"
					class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/vivo/index.php?title=Ontology</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The VIVO ontology is now available via the Bioportal (<a
					href="http://www.bioontology.org/bioportal" class="external-link"
					rel="nofollow">http://www.bioontology.org/bioportal</a>), an open
				repository of ontologies hosted by the National Center for
				Biomedical Ontology.

				contributions of feature requests, requirements development and
				design, ontology design reviews, software development, and testing
				from the larger VIVO open source community.</p>
