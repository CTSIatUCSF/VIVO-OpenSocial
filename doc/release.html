        <h4><a
        name="VIVORelease1.4AnnouncementDRAFT-Overview"></a>Overview</h4>
        <p>VIVO 1.4 introduces two significant new features as well as
        extending development begun in previous releases. Proxy
        editing allows any VIVO user to designate another user as his
        or her proxy for review or update, a much-requested feature,
        and VIVO 1.4 also includes the ability to annotate VIVO
        entries with terms from controlled vocabularies using external
        terminology services. </p>

        <h4><a
        name="VIVORelease1.4AnnouncementDRAFT-Proxyediting"></a>Proxy
        editing</h4> <p>VIVO now allows anyone with a VIVO profile to
        delegate editing privileges for his or her entry to another
        user, or proxy.  Proxy-based editing facilitates adoption and
        updating of VIVO in settings where researchers do not have the
        time to maintain their own entries and wish to delegate
        editing to specific persons.  Proxy editing also supports
        granting a VIVO user the rights to edit other entities such as
        specific organizations, furthering sustainability by
        controlled distribution of editing responsibility. Proxy
        privileges can be managed by VIVO administrators on behalf of
        multiple users or by an individual user on his or her own
        behalf.</p>

        <h4><a
        name="VIVORelease1.4AnnouncementDRAFT-Linkingtoexternalvocabularies"></a>Linking
        to external vocabularies</h4> <p>Many people have requested
        support for associating terms from established controlled
        vocabularies with people, publications, grants, organizations,
        and other types of data in VIVO. While small taxonomies or
        vocabularies may most easily be imported in their entirety
        into VIVO, a number of the more popular controlled
        vocabularies are very large in proportion to the number of
        terms likely to be referenced within a single VIVO
        instance. Incorporating terms by reference helps keep terms in
        sync as these vocabularies continue to evolve and is more
        consistent with linked data principles.

        <p>
          Stony Brook University's Department of Medical
          Bioinformatics, led by Dr. Mois√©s Eisenberg, hosts an RDF
          version of the National Library of Medicine's Unified
          Medical Language System or UMLS
          (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/"
          class="external-link"
          rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/</a>). Through
          a 2011 VIVO mini-grant, Stony Brook has developed a web
          service that accepts incoming term requests from VIVO and
          returns one or more matching UMLS concepts with stable
          URIs. VIVO displays the label associated with the UMLS
          concept but the concept's URI ensures that references remain
          unambiguous, even across multiple VIVO instances at
          different institutions.</p>

        <p>
          The interface from VIVO to the UMLS service has been
          implemented to allow linking to additional vocabulary services such as
          GEMET (<a href="http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet"
                    class="external-link"
                    rel="nofollow">http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet</a>), and we will
          offer additional choices in upcoming releases. </p>

        <h4><a name="VIVORelease1.4AnnouncementDRAFT-Visualizations"></a>Visualizations</h4>
        <p>The VIVO 1.4 release features a novel science maps visualization that supports the comparison of publication profiles of up to three organizations.</p>

        <p>All science map visualizations also now feature the updated
        basemap of science that uses 10 years of publication data
        (2001-2010) from Elsevier's Scopus and Thomson Reuters' Web of
        Science.  The UCSD map was originally created by the Regents
        of the University of California and SciTech Strategies in
        2008. It was updated by SciTech Strategies, L'Observatoire des
        sciences et des technologies, and Indiana University's
        Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS) in
        2011.</p>

        <h4><a name="VIVORelease1.4AnnouncementDRAFT-Ontologychanges"></a>Ontology changes</h4>
        <p>Ontology changes from 1.3 to 1.4 were relatively minor,
        including an update to the Geopolitical Ontology and changes
        to support linking to external vocabulary references as
        described above. Changes for each release are documented on
        the VIVO wiki on Sourceforge
        at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/vivo/index.php?title=Ontology"
        class="external-link"
        rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/vivo/index.php?title=Ontology</a>.</p>

        <p>With version 1.4, the VIVO ontology will be submitted to
        the Bioportal (<a href="http://www.bioontology.org/bioportal"
        class="external-link"
        rel="nofollow">http://www.bioontology.org/bioportal</a>), an
        open repository of ontologies hosted by the National Center
        for Biomedical Ontology, to facilitate access and
        dissemination.</p>

        <h4><a name="VIVORelease1.4AnnouncementDRAFT-Freemarkerconversion"></a>Freemarker conversion</h4>
        <p>VIVO 1.4 continues the major effort begun with version 1.2
        and continued in 1.3 to convert VIVO's entire user-facing code
        base from Java Server Pages (JSPs) to FreeMarker, the Java
        template engine library
        (<a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/"
        class="external-link"
        rel="nofollow">http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/</a>). FreeMarker
        more cleanly separates internal application programming logic
        from page display, making the VIVO application more
        understandable and extensible, especially for developers new
        to VIVO. The entire user-facing editing system has been
        refactored for VIVO 1.4 to simplify the configuration of
        custom forms and allow more rigorous code testing and data
        verification.</p>

        <h4><a name="VIVORelease1.4AnnouncementDRAFT-Improveddiagnostics"></a>Improved diagnostics</h4>
        <p>VIVO 1.4 features improved diagnostic messages to help with
        configuration issues. As VIVO starts up, it runs a series of
        tests looking for common configuration errors. If VIVO finds a
        problem it will display an error or warning message in the
        browser, instead of the VIVO home page. These start-time
        diagnostics and prominent display make it even easier to
        install VIVO.</p>

        <h4><a name="VIVORelease1.4AnnouncementDRAFT-Vitroasastandaloneapplication"></a>Vitro as a standalone application</h4>
        <p>VIVO extends the underlying Vitro open-source semantic web
        application with the VIVO ontology, software customizations
        specific to the VIVO ontology, and visual theming.  With
        version 1.4 of VIVO, the underlying Vitro software has been
        packaged for use independently of the VIVO ontology. Vitro
        supports ontology creation and editing as well as importing
        existing ontologies, and is an excellent tool for populating
        ontologies with instance data, for publishing RDF as linked
        data, and for hands-on teaching about ontologies and semantic
        web concepts.</p>
