                Instructions for connecting VIVO and Open Research Networking Gadgets
            </small>
            <p>
                This document contains instructions on how to configure your VIVO 
                installation to use OpenSocial gadgets.
            </p>
            <p>
                VIVO uses an extension of the OpenSocial protocols called  
                Open Research Networking Gadgets, or ORNG. 
                ORNG is a project of the Clinical & Translational Science Institute at the 
                University of California, San Francisco.
                You can find out more about the ORNG project at their web site, 
                <a href="http://www.opengadgets.org/index.html">http://www.opengadgets.org/index.html</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            	ORNG supports gadgets using a modified version of Apache Shindig.
            	These instructions tell you how to install the Shindig-ORNG web application,
            	and how to configure it to work with VIVO.

            <h2 id="installation">I. Installing and Configuring</h2>
            
            <h3 id="database">I.i. Create database tables and procedures</h3>
            <p>
            	Shindig-ORNG uses several database tables in MySQL to store its data: 
            	which gadgets appear on which pages, how large are the gadgets, 
            	what information applies to each individual, and more.
            	Shindig-ORNG also creates stored procedures in MySQL. These are small 
            	pieces of code that simplify the use of the database tables.
            </p>
            <p>
            	In the VIVO distribution directory, a file called 
            	<em>vitro-core/opensocial/shindig_orng_tables.sql</em> 
            	contains SQL commands that create the tables and 
            	stored procedures for Shindig-ORNG to use.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Tell MySQL to process this file with a command like this:
            	<pre>mysql -u <em>username</em> -p <em>database</em> &lt; <em>sql_file</em></pre>
            	So, if your current directory is the VIVO distibution directory, and your
            	VIVO database is <em>vivoDb</em> and your MySQL user account is <em>vivoUser</em>, 
            	then you might use the command this way:
            	<pre>mysql -u vivoUser -p vivoDb &lt; vitro-core/opensocial/shindig_orng_tables.sql</pre>
            	MySQL will prompt you for the password for your MySQL user account, and then 
            	process the file.
            </p>
            <p>
            	You may want to start your gadget collection with some example gadgets 
            	that have been developed by the ORNG group. The file called 
            	<em>vitro-core/opensocial/shindig_example_gadgets.sql</em> 
            	contains SQL commands that will add these gadgets to your system's configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
            	If you want to load these example gadgets, you can use a command similar to the previous one:
            	<pre>mysql -u vivoUser -p vivoDb &lt; vitro-core/opensocial/shindig_example_gadgets.sql</pre>
            	As before, MySQL will prompt you for the password for your MySQL user account, and then 
            	process the file.
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="config_files">I.ii. Create configuration directory and key file</h3>
            <p>
            	In your VIVO home directory, create a directory called <em>shindig</em>. 
            	Under that, create directories called <em>conf</em> and <em>openssl</em>. 
            	Your VIVO home directory will look something like this:
            	<pre>     [VIVO home directory]
      |
      |--shindig
      |   |
      |   |--conf
      |   |
      |   |--openssl
      |
      |--solr
      |
      |--uploads</pre>
            </p>

            <p>
            	Shindig-ORNG uses an encryption key to insure that the communication 
            	between the gadget and the server is secure. 
            	You should create a file that contains the encryption key, 
            	and store that file in the <em>shindig/openssl</em> directory that you created.
            </p>
            <p>
            	On Unix-based systems (like Linux or Mac OS X), this command will create
            	an encryption key from a random seed:
            	<pre>dd if=/dev/random bs=32 count=1 | openssl base64 > <em>[key-file]</em></pre>
            	For example, if your VIVO home directory is <em>/usr/local/vivo/data</em>, 
            	you might use the command this way:
            	<pre>dd if=/dev/random bs=32 count=1 | openssl base64 > /usr/local/vivo/data/shindig/openssl/securitytokenkey.txt</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
            	If your VIVO installation is installed on a machine that runs Microsoft Windows, 
            	you will need to find another way to create an encryption key. 
            	The easiest way might be to find a Unix-based machine,
            	issue the command above, and copy the resulting file to your Windows machine.
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="tomcat_settings">I.iii. Modify Tomcat settings</h3>
            <p>
            	The Shindig-ORNG application must know where to find the configuration file that you created in 
            	Step I. 
            	It must also know its own URL, so that URL can be inserted into the gadgets.
			</p>            
			<p>
            	This information is provided through startup parameters in Tomcat.
            	With most installations of Tomcat, the "setenv.sh" or 
                "setenv.bat" file in Tomcat's bin directory is a convenient place to  
                set these parameters. 
                <em>If this file does not exist in Tomcat's bin directory, you can create it.</em>
            </p>
			<p>
				Here is an example of the setenv.sh file, showing only the Shindig-ORNG requirements:
				<pre>export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/vivo/data/shindig/conf
export CATALINA_OPTS="-Dshindig.host=localhost -Dshindig.port=8080"</pre>
            </p>
			<p>
				Here is the equivalent file for an installation in Windows.
				<pre>set CLASSPATH=C:\vivo\data\shindig\conf
set CATALINA_OPTS=-Dshindig.host=localhost -Dshindig.port=8080</pre>
            </p>
			<p>
				This assumes that your setenv file was empty before starting this process, 
				and that you used the default location for the Shindig-ORNG configuration file in Step I.
				In fact, it's more common for the setenv file to contain other parameters besides 
				those used for Shindig-ORNG. In that case, it might look more like this:
				<pre>export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/vivo/data/shindig/conf
export CATALINA_OPTS="-Dshindig.host=localhost -Dshindig.port=8080 -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m"</pre>
			</p>            
			<p>
				Or, for Windows:
				<pre>set CLASSPATH=C:\vivo\data\shindig\conf
set CATALINA_OPTS=-Dshindig.host=localhost -Dshindig.port=8080 -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m</pre>
			</p>            
            
            <h3 id="vivo_settings">I.iv Configure VIVO</h3>
            <p>
            	In the VIVO distribution directory, the file called <em>deploy.properties</em>
            	contains configuration options for the VIVO application.
            	You must set some additional parameters so VIVO will be able to communicate with Shindig-ORNG. 
            </p>

            <p>
                At the command line, from the top level of the VIVO distribution 
                directory, type: 
	            <pre>                ant orng</pre>
                to configure the Shindig-ORNG application and deploy it to Tomcat's webapps directory. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	The main VIVO application must also be re-deployed in order to accept the new settings
            	in <em>deploy.properties</em>. At the command line, from the top level of the VIVO distribution 
                directory, type: 
	            <pre>                ant deploy</pre>
	            to re-deploy VIVO with the new settings.
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="confirm">I.vi Does it work?</h3>

            <h4>Startup tests</h4>

            <p>
            	Start VIVO, and verify that you can see VIVO's home page in a browser.
            </p>
            <p>
            	On startup, VIVO runs a series of self-diagnostics, or "smoke tests". If these tests find 
            	any problems with the OpenSocial configuration, you will see a warning message instead of 
            	the VIVO home page.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Some of VIVO's "smoke tests" are run after the startup is finished, and may take up to a minute
            	to complete. If one of these tests fails, you will see the warning message as you 
            	navigate from one VIVO page to the next.
            </p>
            <p>
            	If one of the OpenSocial tests fails, you may continue to use VIVO, but it is
            	likely that no gadgets will be shown. 
            	You can review the warning message by seleting the "Startup Status"
            	link from the "Site Admin" page.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Search page</h4>
            
            <p>
            	If you loaded the example gadgets, you should be able to see the "Google Search" gadget on the
            	Search Results page in VIVO.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Every VIVO installation comes with a geographic data model, so type "Chile" in the search box, 
            	and view the results. Near the bottom of the page, you should see the "OpenSocial" section heading,
            	and beneath it, a gadget offering "Full Text Search Results". This gadget does a google search
            	at UCSF, using the search term that you entered. Again, this gadget is just an example, to show
            	what is possible with OpenSocial gadgets and VIVO.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The first time you bring up the search page, it may take several seconds for the gadget to 
            	appear. After the first time, the gadget response should be must faster.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Profile page</h4>
            
            <p>
            	If your VIVO installation contains profiles of people, you can see several gadgets on their 
            	profile pages. You must be logged in to VIVO, with authority to edit the profile you are 
            	viewing.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Go to a personal profile page in VIVO. If you loaded the example gadgets, you will see
            	the "OpenSocial" section heading above the property lists, with an assortment of
            	example gadgets available for experimentation.
            </p>
            <p>
            	As with the search page, the first appearance of the gadgets may be slow.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

            <p>
            	If the gadgets do not appear as you expect, look for these symptoms, 
            	and check for the corresponding possible causes.
            </p>

	        	Some things to be aware of when working with OpenSocial gadgets.
	        </p>
	        
	        <h3 id="redeploying">III.i. Re-running the deployment script</h2>
	        
	        <p>
	        	The OpenSocial framework relies on several of the settings in the <em>deploy.properties</em> file, 
	        	in addition to the ones that are explicitly linked to it.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	Each time you change the settings in <em>deploy.properties</em>, you should re-deploy
	        	the framework with
	        	<pre>          ant orng</pre>
	        </p>
	        
	        <h3 id="cache">III.ii. Resetting the gadget cache</h2>
	        <p>
	        	For efficiency, VIVO reads the gadget configuration only when it starts up. VIVO keeps
	        	a copy of the database tables in memory, for efficiency.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	This means that if you change the gadget configuration in the database tables, you must
	        	either tell VIVO to read the tables again. Direct your browser to 
	        	the <tt>orng/clearcache</tt> page within VIVO. For example, 
	        	<pre>        http://localhost:8080/vivo/orng/clearcache</pre>
	        	VIVO will re-read the gadget configuration, and display the VIVO home page.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	You can achieve the same effect by restarting VIVO.
	        </p>

			<p>
				<b>TBD</b>
			</p>

	        <h3 id="disabling">III.iv. Disabling the OpenSocial gadgets</h2>

			<p>
				If you decide not to use OpenSocial gadgets in your VIVO installation, 
				there are several ways to deactivate them, depending on how firm your decision is,
				and how thorough you wish to be.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Disable the gadgets</h4>
			
			<p>
				You can disable any or all of the installed gadgets 
				by setting the <em>enabled</em> flag in <em>orng_apps</em> to zero 
				(see <a href="#orng_apps">section II.i. The <em>orng_apps</em> database table</a>).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To make this change take effect, restart Tomcat, or clear the OpenSocial cache
				(see <a href="#cache">section III.ii. Resetting the gadget cache</a>).
			</p>

			<h4>Disable the connection</h4>
			
			<p>
				Disabling the gadgets, as above, will remove essentially all of the OpenSocial processing
				within VIVO. To remove the remainder of it, you can disable the connection between
				VIVO and the OpenSocial service. Do this by removing or commenting 
				the <em>OpenSocial</em> properties in <em>deploy.properties</em> 
				(see <a href="#vivo_settings">section I.iv. Configure VIVO</a>).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To make this change take effect, re-deploy VIVO and restart Tomcat.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Remove the OpenSocial webapp from Tomcat</h4>
			
			<p>
				Disabling the connection, as above, will remove all of the OpenSocial processing
				from your VIVO requests. However, you may still see that Tomcat takes longer to 
				start up, and requires more memory.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To remove the OpenSocial webapp from Tomcat, 
				<ul>
					<li>stop Tomcat;</li>
					<li>in the <tt>[tomcat]/webapps</tt> directory, delete <tt>shindigorng.war</tt> and the 
					<tt>shindigorng</tt> sub-directory;</li>
					<li>start Tomcat.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h4>Clean up the remnants</h4>
			
			<p>
				To remove all traces of OpenSocial from your VIVO installation, you should take the steps
				outlined above, and also:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Remove the <em>orng</em> tables from your MySQL database.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remove the changes to Tomcat by restoring your <em>setenv</em> file to its previous state.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remove the <em>shindig</em> directory and subdirectories from your VIVO home directory.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These steps will have no appreciable effect on the operation of VIVO, Tomcat, or MySQL.
				However, if these artifacts are not removed they could be a source of puzzlement for
				future VIVO maintainers.
			</p>
