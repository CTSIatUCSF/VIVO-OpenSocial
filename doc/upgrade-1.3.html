                This document provides a short description of the steps involved in 
                upgrading your installation of VIVO from Version 1.2+ to Version 1.3.  
                This and other documentation can be found on the <a href="http://vivoweb.org/support">support page</a>
                at <a href="http://vivoweb.org/">VIVOweb.org</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to do a fresh install, please consult the VIVO Release V1.3 Installation 
                Guide found on <a href="http://vivoweb.org/support">vivoweb.org</a>
                or the install.html file located in the <code>doc</code>
                directory of the VIVO source code distribution. The installation document also has a 
                list of the required software and versions (there are no new hardware  
                or software requirements for V1.3). 
            </p>
            <h3 id="announcement">Release Announcement for V1.3</h3>
            <!-- Release Announcement -->VIVO Release V1.3 incorporates changes to the search 
            indexing, user accounts, menu management, ontology, and visualizations, and begins  
            integration of VIVO Harvester functions with VIVO's own ingest tools. 
            <br>
            <h4>Search</h4>
            <p>
                VIVO V1.3 will feature notable improvements to the local search, primarily to improve relevance 
                ranking but also to boost the influence of semantic relationships in the search. This will  
                improve recall by including text from related resources (e.g., adding a person's grant and 
                publication titles to his or her search entry) and by boosting overall relevance ranking 
                based on the number and nature of connections from one individual to others.
            </p>
            <p>
                VIVO is now using Apache Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) in place of Apache Lucene to 
                improve indexing and faceting of search results. The migration to Solr also aligns the  
                local search with the VIVO multi-site search site under development for release prior to 
                the 2011 VIVO Conference.
            </p>
            <h4>Authorization</h4>
            <p>
                Release V1.3 provides an entirely new model of authorization within the 
                VIVO application to allow more granular control over system 
                configuration and editing. The first phase of the new user account  
                interface is included in V1.3. This interface provides a user search, a 
                root acount, and password reset functionality where the password gets  
                emailed to the user. The next phase will provide the ability to create 
                new roles. 
            </p>
            <h4>Menu management</h4>
            <p>
                The menus across the top of the site (Home, People, Organizations, 
                Research, Events) can now be managed in a web form instead of editing  
                an RDF file. In addition to making site management much easier, 
                form-based editing also allows more control over what classes of data  
                are displayed and provides a mechanism to limit certain menu pages to 
                content identified as internal to the institution. 
            </p>
            <h4>FreeMarker template improvements</h4>
            <p>
                While less directly visible to the public, V1.3 also includes 
                additional changes focused directly on supporting open source community  
                involvement in extending and customizing VIVO. The development team 
                began a year ago to transition VIVO&#39;s code base away from Java Server  
                Pages to the FreeMarker page templating system that much more cleanly 
                separates internal application programming logic from page display. 
            </p>
            <h4>Visualization</h4>
            <p>
                The visualization team has implemented a Map of Science visualization,
                which allows users to visually explore the scientific strengths of a
                university, school, department, or person in the VIVO instance. Users
                will be able to see where an organization or person&#39;s interests lay
                across 13 major scientific disciplines or 554 sub-disciplines, and will 
                be able to see how these disciplines and sub-disciplines interrelate 
                with one another on the Map of Science. Wireframes and design  
                documentation for upcoming enhanced versions of the Map of Science 
                visualization have already been developed; the Map of Science  
                visualization will most likely be in the form of a PDF that a user can 
                download. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Several visualizations also now provide a caching feature that improves 
                performance after the initial processing. 
            </p>
            <h4>QR Codes</h4>
            <p>
                Pages for people in VIVO now have an icon for displaying QR codes to allow 
                capturing names and available contact information on mobile devices.
            </p>
            <h4>Harvester Integration</h4>
            <p>
                VIVO sites have the option with Release 1.3 of coordinating the configuration 
                of VIVO and the Harvester to enable many Harvester functions to be initiated  
                from the VIVO Ingest Tools menu in support of more unified and centralized 
                management for data ingest. 
            </p>
            <h4>Ontology changes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    support for certifications and licenses 
                </li>
                <li>
                    expanded support for intellectual property (patents) (it was 
                    there as stub before but didn't allow common things such as assignee  
                    and issuer) 
                </li>
                <li>
                    support for editorial, reviewing and organizing activities 
                </li>
                <li>
                    expanded shared geographical instance data vocabulary to include 
                    the 50 U.S. states 
                </li>
                <li>
                    representing specific types of EducationalTraining: 
                    PostdoctoralTraining, Internship, MedicalResidency 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Linked open data</h4>
            <p>
                Responses to linked data requests have been enhanced to include 
                additional context about any individual, in working toward a goal of  
                being able to provide all the data in a person's profile available as 
                RDF via a single web request.

                    Please ensure that backups are created of the: 
                </p>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    The upgrade process is similar to the original install process 
                    with  
                    the following EXCEPTIONS:

                    <li>
                        If you are still in RDB mode, it is required that you move 
                        your  
                        triple store to SDB while still at V1.2 (see <a href="#triple_store">Triple

                        DO NOT reinstall MySQL or recreate the MySQL database. Please 
                        ensure that you back-up the MySQL database. Also note that VIVO 1.2  
                        will not run on older versions of MySQL that may have worked with 
                        1.1.1. Be sure to run VIVO 1.2 with MySQL 5.1 or higher. Using  
                        unsupported versions may result in strange error messages related to 
                        table formatting or other unexpected problems.

                    <br>
                </h4>
                <p>
                    VIVO 1.3 now requires you to use Jena's SPARQL database (SDB) for 
                    the triple store technology.&nbsp; Jena's legacy relational database  
                    store (RDB) was used by VIVO 1.1.1 and earlier.&nbsp; Both SDB and RDB 
                    were available in VIVO 1.2 and 1.2.1.&nbsp; It is required that you  
                    move your triple store to SDB while still at V1.2. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    SDB mode caches only a fraction of the RDF data in memory. Most
                    queries are issued directly against the underlying database. This
                    allows VIVO installations to display data from large RDF models while
                    requiring only a small amount of server memory to run the application.
                    There is a tradeoff in response time: pages may take slightly longer to 
                    load in SDB mode, and performance will depend on the configuration 
                    parameters of the database server. Additionally, advanced OWL reasoning  
                    (not enabled by default in either mode) is not possible in SDB mode. 
                    With SDB, only the default set of inferences (inferred rdf:type  
                    statements) are generated, and they are generated as soon as data is 
                    edited rather than in a background process. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A conversion from RDB to SDB mode can take a number of hours to 
                    complete if the installation contains a large amount of RDF data  
                    (roughly a million triples or more).&nbsp; You can start the conversion 
                    process in the background while the RDB system is running. This will  
                    reduce the delay in initial startup after the application is redeployed 
                    with deploy.properties set for SDB. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note
                        that it is important not to edit any data anywhere in the application
                        while this background conversion is running</span>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start the SDB conversion, log in as a system administrator and 
                    request /sdbsetup (for example, if your VIVO is installed at  
                    http://vivo.myuniversity.edu/ you would type 
                    http://vivo.myuniversity.edu/sdbsetup into your browser). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Click the button that appears on this page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the course of the SDB setup, which may take several hours
                    on 
                    a large database, subsequent requests to /sdbsetup will display a 
                    message that the operation is still in progress. When a request for  
                    this page shows a message that the SDB setup has completed 
                    successfully, shut down Tomcat, set deploy.properties to SDB mode,  
                    redeploy, and restart Tomcat. VIVO will now be running from the SDB 
                    store.

                    The vivo-basic theme was deprecated with VIVO V1.2 and is no longer 
                    present in the V1.3 release as it does not support V1.2 or V1.3  
                    features. It is highly recommended that you use the wilma theme or 
                    modify the wilma theme for branding or to create a custom look and  
                    feel. Please see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/vivo/index.php?title=Site_Administrator_Guide">Site Administration Guide</a>

                            methods now take the full tag as an argument. 
                            This will require a change to all calls to these methods in the  
                            templates. This change allows for specification of attributes such as <code>media</code>
                            directly in the tag. For example: 
                        </p>

                            path to the url, so the full url must be specified in the tag.

                    In V1.3, the VIVO authorization system has some extensive 
                    changes. In summary, these are:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each user will have a user account, even if the user logs in 
                        with Shibboleth or some other external authentication system. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        E-mail is used to notify users when an account is created for 
                        them, or when an administrator edits their account. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A "root" user account exists which has access to all pages and 
                        all data fields. This is a powerful tool that can hold some surprises.

                            With V1.3, each authenticated user will have a user 
                            account. If someone logs in using an external authentication system,  
                            and no user account matches their external login credentials, an 
                            account will be created.

                            Prior to V1.3, each user account was identified by a 
                            Username field. This field was labeled as &quot;E-mail address&quot; on some  
                            pages in VIVO, but no mail was ever sent. In V1.3, this has 
                            changed, so the e-mail address is fully used, both for identification  
                            and for communication with the user.

                            Prior to V1.3, the Username field (also referred to as 
                            'e-mail address') was used for several purposes:

                            created, and providing a link to VIVO that will allow them to set a 
                            password on the account.

                            account will not require a password, and the e-mail notification 
                            message to the user will not provide a password link.

                            When an administrator edits a user account, he may choose to 
                            reset the password. As with a new account, the user will receive  
                            notification with a link to VIVO that will allow them to set a new 
                            password. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a user changes the e-mail address on his account, he will 
                            receive a notification message to that effect.

                            If a user account is auto-created for a user with external 
                            authentication credentials, the user will receive a notification

                            The e-mail notification relies on two configuration 
                            properties: <code>email.smtpHost</code>
                            and <code>email.replyTo</code>. If either of these properties is 
                            missing or empty, VIVO will not attempt to send e-mail notifications to  
                            users. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This can be useful for small or experimental installations of 
                            VIVO, or where e-mail notification is not desired. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If e-mail notifications are disabled, an administrator must 
                            set  
                            a password on each new account, since the user will have no way of 
                            setting it. When the user logs in for the first time, VIVO will require  
                            them to change their password to one of their own choosing.

                            The root account is not a site

                            is 
                            more powerful than a site administrator&#39;s account. The root account is 
                            permitted to visit any page in a VIVO application. It is permitted to  
                            see any data property, and to enter data into any field. As such, the 
                            root account can be very useful and rather dangerous. It can also give  
                            you a distorted view of what your VIVO site looks like, since data is 
                            shown here which ins not visible to other accounts.

                            The best way to use the root account is to create a site 
                            administrator&#39;s account. After that, use the root account only when

                    automated, so manual review of the knowledge base is recommended after

                        displayRankAnnot or displayLimitAnnot) so that it is no longer using 
                        the default, then that setting will be left unchanged.

                        new default value will be propagated to the knowledge base.

                <p>
                    VIVO comes with a "Terms of Use" statement linked from the footer.  The "Site Name" 
                    you assign in the "Site Information" form under the <strong>Site Admin</strong>
                    area will be 
                    inserted into the "Terms of Use" statement.  If you want to edit the text content more than just 
                    the "Site Name", the file can be found here:<pre>[vivo_source_dir]/vitro-core/webapp/web/templates/freemarker/body/termsOfUse.ftl</pre>
                    Be sure to make the changes in your source files and deploy them to your tomcat so you don't lose 
                    your changes next time you deploy for another reason.
