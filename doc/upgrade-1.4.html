            <small>
                December 9, 2011 - Upgrading from Release 1 V1.3 to Release 1 V1.4
            </small>
            <p>
                This document contains instructions on how to upgrade your 
                installation of VIVO from Version 1.3 to Version 1.4.  
                This and other documentation can be found on the <a href="http://vivoweb.org/support">support page</a>
                at <a href="http://vivoweb.org/">VIVOweb.org</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to do a fresh install, please consult the VIVO Release V1.4 Installation 
                Guide found on <a href="http://vivoweb.org/support">vivoweb.org</a>
                or the install.html file located in the <code>doc</code>
                directory of the VIVO source code distribution. The installation document also has a 
                list of the required software and versions (there are no new hardware  
                or software requirements for V1.4).

                Create backups of: 
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>
                    The VIVO distribution directory (which contains the source for VIVO 1.3)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The VIVO home directory (pointed to by your deploy.properties file)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The webapps directory in Tomcat 
                </li>
                <li>
                    MySQL database (most people use mysqldump to create the backup) 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The upgrade process is similar to the initial install process 
                with  
                the following exceptions: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You do not need to reinstall MySQL or recreate the MySQL database. Please 
                    backup your MySQL database as noted above. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    First-time login of the root account after the upgrade  
                    process is complete will use the password previously set (not the 
                    default password used on the first login after the initial  
                    installation.) 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first time Apache Tomcat starts up after the upgrade, an automated 
                    process will modify the knowledge base to align the  
                    data with any ontology updates made for the new release. See the section on the <a href="#kbm">Knowledge Base Migration</a>
                    below for more information.

                            In order for VIVO to correctly handle international characters,
                            you must configure Tomcat to conform to the URI standard by
                            accepting percent-encoded UTF-8.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Edit Tomcat's conf/server.xml and add the following attribute to each of the
                            Connector elements: URIEncoding="UTF-8".
                        </p>

                <p>
                    2. Create a new deploy.properties using the same settings as in

                            Default namespace: VIVO installations make their
                            RDF resources available for harvest using linked data. Requests for RDF
                            resource URIs redirect to HTML or RDF representations as specified by
                            the client. To make this possible, VIVO's default namespace must have a
                            certain structure and begin with the public web address of the VIVO
                            installation. For example, if the web address of a VIVO installation is
                            "http://vivo.example.edu/" the default namespace must be set to
                            "http://vivo.example.edu/individual/" in order to support linked data.
                            Similarly, if VIVO is installed at "http://www.example.edu/vivo" the

                    The knowledge base migration process described in the next section will generate logs. 
                    These logs will be overwritten if you redeploy the VIVO application (but not if you restart tomcat), and since
                    they may be a useful reference if questions come up about your 1.4 VIVO data after deployment, you should save them aside.
                    The logs are created in the Tomcat <code>webapps/vivo/WEB-INF directory</code>:

                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        A log of a summary of updates that were made to the knowledge 
                        base. This file should end with "Finished knowledge base migration". 
                        If this file contains any warnings they should be reviewed with your 
                        implementation team representative to see whether any corrective action needs to be taken. 
                    </dd>

                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        A log of errors that were encountered during the upgrade 
                        process. This file should be empty if the upgrade was successful. If any errors are encountered
                        you will need to rerun the knowledge base migration.

                <p>
                    Changes to the VIVO core ontology may require corresponding 
                    modifications to the knowledge base instance data and ontology annotations.
                    When VIVO first starts up following the upgrade, it will 
                    initiate a process to examine the knowledge base and apply necessary  
                    changes. The knowledge base migration process will make the following types of changes:

                        All references to the class (in the subject or object 
                        position) will be updated to the new name. References to the property will be 
                        updated to the new name.

                        All type assertions of a deleted class will be removed. 
                        <br>
                        All statements using a deleted property will be changed to use the 
                        nearest available superproperty. If there is no available superproperty  
                        then the statement will be deleted from the knowledge base. Note that 
                        all removed and added data is recorded in the files in the changedData  
                        directory.

                    <dd>
                        If a site has modified the value of a vitro annotation (such 
                        as  
                        displayRankAnnot or displayLimitAnnot) so that it is no longer using 
                        the default, then that setting will be left unchanged. 
                        <br>
                        If a site is using the default value of a vitro annotation, and the 
                        default has been changed in the new version of the ontology, then the  
                        new default value will be propagated to the knowledge base.

                <h4 id="reviewkbm">ii. Knowledge Base Manual Review for Local Extensions</h4>
                Not all of the modifications that may be required are  
                    automated. If you have local extensions to areas of the ontology that have changed, a manual review of the knowledge base is recommended after  
                    the automated upgrade process.
                <h3 id="termsofuse">V. Review the VIVO Terms of Use</h3>
                <p>
                    VIVO comes with a "Terms of Use" statement linked from the footer.  The "Site Name" 
                    you assign in the "Site Information" form under the <strong>Site Admin</strong>
                    area will be 
                    inserted into the "Terms of Use" statement.  If you want to edit the text content more than just 
                    the "Site Name", the file can be found here:<pre>[vivo_source_dir]/vitro-core/webapp/web/templates/freemarker/body/termsOfUse.ftl</pre>
                    Be sure to make the changes in your source files and deploy them to your tomcat so you don't lose 
                    your changes next time you deploy for another reason.
